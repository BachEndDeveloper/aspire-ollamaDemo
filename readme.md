# Test project .Net ASPIRE and Semantic Kernel with Ollama

This is a test project for testing ASPIRE with Ollama and Semantic Kernel.

There is also my testing setting up MongoDB with ASPIRE

## Requirements

- .Net 9 SDK ([Instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/))
- .Net ASPIRE 9 ([Instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling))
- Docker Desktop ([Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/))

## Instructions

When requirements are installed, use your favorite IDE, compatible with .Net ASPIRE.
Run the AppHost project - ASPIRE should take care of the rest.
